# Micro‑Survey Pulse (Synthetic)

Short, focused survey example for quick pulses to different cohorts (Non‑Degree, UG, GRAD).

## What's here
- `data/microsurvey_responses.csv` — 300 synthetic responses with three Likert items (1–5) and a 0–10 recommendation score.
- Visuals:
  - `fig_recommendation_hist.png`
  - `fig_likert_by_cohort.png`
- `src/analyze_micro.py` — computes cohort-level means and an NPS-style summary.

> Synthetic and anonymized; safe for public repos.
