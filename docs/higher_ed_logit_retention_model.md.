Model specification:

`retention_next_term ~ gpa_term + satisfaction_overall + unmet_need + C(program_level)`

## Interpretation — Persistence model

Higher term GPA increases the odds that a student returns next term. Each step up in performance is linked with better persistence, even after adjusting for satisfaction, unmet need, and program level.

Higher overall satisfaction also increases retention odds. Students who feel more satisfied with their experience are more likely to re-enroll, which echoes the idea that “service quality is a retention strategy.”

Unmet financial need works in the opposite direction. As unmet need rises, the odds of returning drop. This highlights how financial stress can undercut otherwise strong academic and experiential signals.

Graduate students generally have higher retention odds than undergraduates in this synthetic sample. That pattern is common in many institutions and reminds us that first-time undergraduates often require more intensive wraparound support.

Taken together, the model shows retention as a multifactor outcome. Academic performance, student experience, and net price are interlocking levers that need coordinated strategies rather than siloed fixes.
