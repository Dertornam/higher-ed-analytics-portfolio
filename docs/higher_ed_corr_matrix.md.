This table includes correlations among GPA, credits attempted and completed, satisfaction indices, unmet financial need, financial aid flags, and retention.

## Interpretation — Correlations

Academic performance and satisfaction are positively related. Students with higher term GPA tend to report higher overall satisfaction and give higher recommendation scores.

Credits completed shows positive associations with GPA and retention. Students who finish more of what they attempt are more likely to persist to the next term.

Unmet financial need tends to correlate negatively with satisfaction and retention. As net cost rises, students are slightly less satisfied and a bit less likely to return, even when controlling only at the bivariate level.

These correlations do not prove causality, but they highlight plausible levers. Academic support, customer-centered services, and financial support should be viewed as connected systems rather than isolated interventions.
