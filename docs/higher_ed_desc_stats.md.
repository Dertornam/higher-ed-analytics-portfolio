The dataset includes student-level records with program level, modality, credits, GPA, satisfaction scores, financial indicators, and retention status.

## Interpretation — Descriptive statistics

Most students attempt a typical full-time load each term and complete a high share of attempted credits. Term GPA and cumulative GPA tend to sit above the 3.0 mark, with graduate students usually a little higher than undergraduates.

Overall satisfaction scores fall in the “satisfied” range on a 1–5 scale. Satisfaction with advising, online services, and facilities tracks closely with overall satisfaction but varies across modalities and programs.

Financial aid flags and unmet need show that many students still carry non-trivial unpaid cost, even when they receive some form of aid. That sets up later analyses on how financial strain interacts with satisfaction and retention.

Retention_next_term is coded as 0 or 1. The distribution shows that most students return, but a meaningful minority do not, which is enough variation to support logistic regression and subgroup comparisons.
