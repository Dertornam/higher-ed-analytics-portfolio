The model:  
`Overall satisfaction ~ Modality (Online, On-campus, Hybrid)`

## Interpretation — Modality and experience

The ANOVA shows a statistically significant effect of modality on overall satisfaction. At least one modality has a mean satisfaction score that differs meaningfully from the others.

In this synthetic dataset, online students tend to report slightly higher satisfaction than on-campus students, with hybrid students often in the middle. That pattern fits a story where flexibility and well-designed online services help boost perceived experience.

For leaders, the implication is not that one modality is “best,” but that expectations and support structures differ. On-campus students rely more on physical facilities and in-person services, while online students depend heavily on digital services and timely communication.

A practical next step would be to follow this ANOVA with item-level comparisons. You can then pinpoint which dimensions of experience drive the modality differences and where targeted improvements could have the most impact.
