## Interpretation — ANOVA (overall satisfaction by modality)

**What the test says.**  
Average overall satisfaction is not the same across modalities. The F-statistic is large and the p-value is effectively zero, so the differences in mean satisfaction between Online, On-campus, and Hybrid students are very unlikely to be due to random noise.

**What it means.**  
Modality itself is tied to how students experience the institution. In this synthetic dataset, online students tend to report slightly higher satisfaction, hybrid students sit in the middle, and on-campus students report somewhat lower scores. That pattern fits a story where flexibility, well-designed online services, and predictable digital touchpoints shape how students rate their overall experience.

**Actions.**  
Use this ANOVA as a screening step. Follow up with item-level comparisons to see which dimensions drive the gap (advising, communication, online services, facilities). Then partner with modality owners: improve digital services and communication for online students to protect their advantage, and use the findings to target specific pain points for on-campus students rather than treating all modalities as if they face the same experience challenges.
